# Coding Challenge - Due Date is Thursday June 15, 2017 at 12 PM PST

This weeks challenge is to write a simple encryption algorithm to encrypt a dataset of your choice such that to decrypt it, you must have the generated key. You can use any algorithm you'd like, some possible suggestions are [AES](http://aesencryption.net/) and [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). Bonus points if your algorithm is more complex, like SHA-256. Good luck!

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/LZEHOlZY2To) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. This is a very simple blockchain implemented in Python that doesn't use proof-of-work (so its vulnerable to Sybil attack). The original Javascript version uses an HTTP server so you can run that [here](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain). 

## Dependencies

None

## Usage

This is just for demonstration purposes. To actually make HTTP requests to this blockchain, see the JS version I've linked in the overview section.

## Credits

Credits for this code go to [k5trismegistus](https://github.com/k5trismegistus). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
